# Adomain

Simplified domain parsing

```ruby
Adomain["abc.xyz.com/path&key=value"]
# => "abc.xyz.com"

Adomain["https://abc.xyz.com"]
# => "abc.xyz.com"

Adomain["https://www.xyz.com"]
# => "xyz.com"
```

Adomain returns the URL host, stripping 'www' by default, scheming your URL if necessary (with "https://").
Optionally, you can strip subdomains or keep 'www' subdomains -- see below.

[`Addressable::URI.parse`](https://github.com/sporkmonger/addressable#example-usage) performs the parsing.

## Other methods and options

`[]` is an alias for `Adomain.subdomain()`

```ruby
Adomain["http://abc.xyz.com"] == Adomain.subdomain("http://abc.xyz.com")
# => true
```

Adomain only has a few other public methods:

### Stripping all subdomains

```ruby
Adomain.domain "http://abc.xyz.com" # => "xyz.com"
```

### Keeping all subdomains, including 'www'

```ruby
Adomain.subdomain_www "http://www.xyz.com" # => "www.xyz.com"
```

Optionally, each method accepts boolean values,
allowing you to contort the method to do something other
than what it says it does. Don't do this, unless you want to.

### A gotcha: Adomain returns nil for some invalid values

Because Adomain adds a scheme to any string passed to it
Addressable does not error out. So, Adomain returns nil
when presented with otherwise-valid strings
for which Addressable cannot find a domain.

```ruby
Adomain["hola"]     # => nil
Adomain["::::::::"] # => nil
Adomain[""]         # => Addressable::URI::InvalidURIError
Adomain["{}"]       # => Addressable::URI::InvalidURIError
```

## Installation
